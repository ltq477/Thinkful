    "## The Scraping Process\n",
    "In order to properly parse web sites for data we will need to perform a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Identify the website where the data is located\n",
    "2. Verify that scraping the data does not violate the site's policies\n",
    "3. Manually examine the web site with Chrome Developer Tools\n",
    "  - learn the HTML structure of the site\n",
    "  - learn how the data is requested by the site - that is, how is the URL of the website structured to get the data\n",
    "4. Use the `requests` library to fetch the HTML code of the  website\n",
    "5. Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the content\n",
    "6. Follow links to get more data\n",
    "7. Store the data in a file for future analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will look at two examples. First, we will scrape a list of jokes from this page: http://pun.me/pages/funny-jokes.php. Then we will scrape a list of questions from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jokes\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first example, let us fetch the HTML code for the web page found at http://pun.me/pages/funny-jokes.php. There is a list of 50 jokes on this page. Open the URL in your Chrome web browser then open the Chrome Developer Tools. To open the developer tools, click on the more options icon in the top right hand corner of your Chrome window, then click More Tools then Developer Tools.\n",

    "![Open Dev Tools](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7874/32380905107_f0c79fa663_z.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the developer tools window, select the Elements tab. In this tab the HTML code for the web page is displayed. As you move your mouse pointer over the code, the relevant parts of the webpage are highlighted. See if you can find the HTML code associated with the jokes themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "![HTML Code](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7881/32380910067_f7eb8b9927_o.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot going on in the HTML code, but as you drill down into the code you will find the section of code that starts like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    <div style=\"float:left;width:100%;\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"content\">\n",
    "            <p>\n",
    "                Our most-liked jokes which are genuinely funny - this list of jokes has been hand selected and contain a variety of clever, clean and silly jokes so be prepared to laugh.\n",
    "            </p>\n",
    "            <ol>\n",
    "             <li>Today at the bank, an old lady asked me to help check her balance. So I pushed her over.</li>\n",
    "            <li>I bought some shoes from a drug dealer. I don't know what he laced them with, but I've been tripping all day.</li>\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you move your mouse pointer over that section of code, the list of jokes itself is highlighted. In order to be able to parse the HTML code to extract the data, you will need to understand a little about the structure of HTML. If you are already familiar with HTML then you are all set, but if you are new to the language then there are a few things to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is made up of elements. An element is constructed from tags. A tag looks like this: `<tagname>`. In the code above, you can see that there are `<div>` tags, `<p>` tags, an `<ol>` tag and some `<li>` tags. Each tag has a corresponding close tag, which looks just like the tag but with a slash. So the `<li>` tag has a corresponding close `</li>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `li` element is made up of the open and close `li` tags with some content between them like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    <li>Today at the bank, an old lady asked me to help check her balance. So I pushed her over.</li>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The element simply tells the browser what to display and maybe some information about the content. For instance, `<p>` is for a paragraph of text, `<ol>` is for ordered lists, that is numbered lists, and `<li>` is a list item. Notice how the `<ol>` element contains a number of `<li>` elements. Notice also that each `<li>` element corresponds to a single numbered item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a great many other elements on the page but they are for the headings and menus and navigations that we are not interested in right now. You can typically use the Chrome Developer tools to drill down to the most relevant elements on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is simple enough that the URL does not need any special attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetch the Code\n",
    "The next step is to fetch the HTML code from the website using the Python `requests` library. This is the same library that you used to request data from an API earlier, except in this case we are not fetching JSON data. Instead we can use the `text` property to get the HTML code."

    "Parsing the HTML code that makes up a web page can be quite difficult, especially as there is no guarantee that the code is formatted correctly or consistently with any standard. Web pages are notoriously broken. Your web browser does a heroic job of rendering web pages even when they are broken, so even if you visit a website and it looks fine, that does not mean that the code is actually fine. In addition, to build a polite scraper as defined above requires even more complexity in your code. There are several good libraries that can help you navigate through the HTML code. We will use [BeatifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to simplify the parsing.\n",

    "## Following a link\n",
    "Now that we can scrape the list of questions from the first page, what about the other pages? Let's look at the HTML code for the next button.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "    <a \n",
    "       href=\"/questions?tab=newest&amp;page=2\" \n",
    "       rel=\"next\" \n",
    "       title=\"go to page 2\">\n",
    "          <span class=\"page-numbers next\"> next</span> \n",
    "    </a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next button is made up of a clickable link styled to look like a button. The `href` attribute of the link contains the URL of the next page. The URL of this button is `/questions?tab=newest&amp;page=2`. First, that is only part of a URL. A URL is made up of the domain name and path and optional query string. Since we are on the `https://stackoverflow.com/questions` website the browser knows that if we click this link we want to remain on the same website and just visit a different path. So the actual request will be sent to `https://stackoverflow.com/questions?tab=newest&amp;page=2`. The bit after the `?` is called the query string and it is one way to send data to the server describing what you are requesting. It appears that this link will accept a parameter named `page` representing the page number. If you click on the next button several times you will notice that the bit at the end of the URL that says `page=2` changes to `page=3` then `page=4` and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "That means that we can modify the URL by incrementing the page number and request more questions. We can continue to do so until there are no more pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "To set the query string on the request URL we can use the `params` parameter on the get method. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "page_number = 1\n",
    "query = {'tab':'newest', 'page': page_number}\n",
    "url = 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions'\n",
    "response = requests.get(url, params=query)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then update the `page_number` variable and repeat this call.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises a few questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - how do we know when there are no more pages?\n",
    " - if we rapidly sent many requests for many pages to the server would we overwhelm the server and possibly get ourselves blocked?\n",
    " \n",
    "There may be several answers to the first question. If you go to the website and visit the last page of results you will see that the next button is not displayed on that page. So the absence of the next button  could be the condition on which we stop the processing. There may be others that you can readily spot but we will go with that option for now. The next button does not contain a class or id that we can easily select it by. However, it does have an attribute `rel` with value `next`. It is possible to select an element by the value of an attribute like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(soup.select('a[rel=\"next\"]'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one does not rely on the HTML structure of the page, but rather on the way we code up the solution. The above code would process a  page of questions and create a list of dictionaries from that page. To repeat that we need some sort of loop that will iterate over all pages and for each page perform something similar to the code that we already wrote. When we get to the last page, we stop the loop, and at that point we will have a list of all questions on the website. The problem is, the computer would process the page rapidly enough that the request for the next page would happen faster than if a human were browsing the website. This of course would act like a denial of service attack against the website and since most web servers can identify such attacks and take steps to protect themselves, we want to avoid such behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to deliberately slow down the rate of requests that we make. We can, for instance, wait for a few seconds before making another request. How long, exactly, will depend. If we wait 1 second between requests, and we need to request 500 pages, then that is at least 500 seconds for our program to run. That is not so bad since hopefully scraping the data is a one time affair. There are some libraries that help to moderate your request rate if you are buiding a more sophisticated scraper. For our simple scraper we can use Python's `sleep()` method to pause execution for a short time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's add one more artificial restriction. There are over 1.2 million pages of questions on the website (at the time of writing, so there will be many more by the time you read this). To avoid making over a million requests and having our program take days to run, we can deliberately only request the first ten pages. Once we have a working program we can always modify the number of pages that we request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some other considerations\n",
    "Before we jump into the code there are a few other considerations that we should make since we are requesting multiple pages. We should clearly identify ourselves to the web server. That is, when your browser makes a request to a web server, it sends along a header named **User-Agent** with a value that identifies the browser itself. For instance, in Chrome the value looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.121 Safari/537.36\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And in Firefox the value looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/63.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the web server can track how many visitors use a particular browser. We can set a value that identifies us and at least provide a contact. If the website owners wish, they may contact us to get some clarity on why we are scraping data from their website and maybe negotiate a better experience for themselves as well as us. We could provide a value like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "'questionscraper - school project (yourname@gmail.com)'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when making the request, we could set the header like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "url = '...'\n",
    "headers = {'user-agent': 'questionscraper - school project (yourname@gmail.com)'}\n",
    "response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration is monitoring the program as it runs. We are potentially creating a program that may take 10, 15 or 20 minutes or even more to run. It would be important to \"see\" what is happening as the program runs. This helps us to follow the progress, ensure the  program isn't hung up, and to detect problems early. We could simply print the number of requests that have been made so far, the frequency of the requests, the number of items found so far, and any errors encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of this together can be a bit daunting, but careful step by step thought will make it possible. A complete working program is given below. Before you run it, ensure you set your email address in the header. Also, a variable named `MAX_REQUESTS` was created to set an upper limit on the number of requests made. You may adjust this value as you wish."
