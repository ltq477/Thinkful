    "These attributes are pretty cool, but where do they come from? Let's find out.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Abstraction and inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about abstraction for a moment. Consider the statement `1 + 2` and the statement `1 + 'pizza'`. We expect the first statement to work because both operands are _numbers_, and we (rightly) expect the second statement to fail because you can't add a number and a string. The operands in the second example aren't _the same type of thing_.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean when we say a number and a string aren't \"the same type\"? Similarly, what do we mean when we say something like \"integers are a type of number\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases above we're making abstractions. Each integer has a whole bunch of attributes it shares with other integers, attributes it doesn't necessarily share with a string. For example, numbers can be even or odd, composite or prime, but those concepts don't even make sense when talking about strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, different types of numbers share some attributes but not others. All integers are divisible by one, but other types of real numbers (like floats) don't have that attribute. \"Number\" is an abstract class that both integers and floats belong to, even though they're different from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases we can intellectually abstract away from specific instances of something (like `1` and `10` and `42`) to create a \"class\" (in this case, integers) where we list out all the attributes that the instances share with one another. Whenever we chose a specific instance of the class you know that the instance inherits all of the properties of the class it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this talk about abstraction is a bit heady, so let's look at the way Python creates different types of numbers using **classes** as a concrete example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers and floats are both a type of number. Python has a [numbers class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Number) that ints and floats belong to. They inherit the attributes of that class. Rational numbers are another type of number. Integers are rational numbers but floats aren't, so integers inherit the attributes of the [rational class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Rational) but floats don't. You can read more detail about this and related numeric classes [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html), but the takeaway is that Python classes give us a way to define a type of object and allow all objects of a certain type to inherit the attributes of their class. All the unexpected attributes you saw on the object `1` above are inherited from the classes it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom objects\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist you can keep on using all of Python's built-in objects and the objects you import from the standard library and other modules (more on importing modules next) without needing to worry too much about making your own custom objects. But seeing how custom objects work will help you understand objects in general, so we'll look at an example of setting up your own custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to model a bunch of quarks. Each of your quarks will have its own color (red, green, or blue) and flavor (up, down, strange, charm, top, or bottom). All quarks will have the same baryon number (`1 / 3`) and will have a method to interact with another quark by exchanging colors (modeling the strong interaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start churning out quarks you first define what you _mean_ by quark, or, in Python terms, you need to define the `class`. Let's see what that class might look like."

    "Let's break down this example piece by piece. In the first line we use the `class` keyword to start the definition of a new class. This works just like the `def` keyword when defining new functions. After that comes the name of our new class (`Quark`). It's customary to use \"[CapWords](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names)\" capitalization with custom classes. We follow the class name with parentheses containing the class we want \"subclass\" from. If you don't have a more specific class you'd like to subclass, the built-in `object` object has the most basic default attributes you want to inherit.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"But wait\", you say, \"what about the first `self` argument?\" Good question. In an object, the `self` variable is used to refer to the object itself. Every method expects `self` as the first argument, and whenever you call a method `self` is passed in behind the scenes without you having to explicitly include it in your method call. When you're reading code that includes `self` you can mentally replace that with \"the particular object I'm dealing with\", so in English `self.color = color` would read as:\n",
