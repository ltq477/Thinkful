    "In Python there are two primary data types for representing numbers: **integers**, which represent whole numbers like `8`, `42`, and `1337`, and **floats**, or floating point numbers, which represent decimal fractions like `3.5`, `0.2` or `0.6000000000000001`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 can represent integers up to any size. Floats, however, [are limited](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) on how precisely they can be represented. Floats in Python are \"double precision\" binary floating-point numbers that will represent decimal fractions as precisely as possible with the [52 bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format#IEEE_754_double-precision_binary_floating-point_format:_binary64). You don't need to know a lot about floating-point errors except that this imprecision makes math a bad idea when you need precise comparisons:"
