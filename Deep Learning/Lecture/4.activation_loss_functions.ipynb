    "# What is the role of activation functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The reason why activation functions are so crucial in deep learning models is that they introduce non-linearity to the models**. For a feed-forward neural network, they are actually the only non-linearity in the model. To understand what if we don't use a non-linear activation function, first remember how we apply activation function to the output of the linear transformation in a neuron:\n",
    "\n",
    "![single neuron](single_neuron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in the figure above, a neuron first sums up each element of the input by multiplying their associated weights. This is just a linear transformation of the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y=b+x_1*w_1+x_2*w_2+...+x_n*w_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation functions come into play after this linear transformation. A neuron gives the result of the previous summation to an activation function and returns the result of that activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Activation\\_fn(y) = Activation\\_fn(b+x_1*w_1+x_2*w_2+...+x_n*w_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "n represents the size of the input vector (or the number of features), $x_1,...,x_n$ represents the values in the input vector of size n and $b$ represents the bias term. $w_1,...,w_n$ represents the weights of the neuron. **$b$ and $w_i$'s are the parameters to be estimated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the role of the activation functions, assume that neurons in a layer just output the results of the linear summations. These will be the inputs of the next layer. Again assume that the neurons of the next layer also output the results of their linear summations. Hence, the output of a neuron in this second layer would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_2 = b + o_1*w_1+o_2*w_2+...+o_n*w_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $o_1, o_2,..., o_n$ denotes the outputs of the neurons of the previous layer. If we substitute $o_1, o_2,..., o_n$ like $o_1 = b+x_1*w_1+x_2*w_2+...+x_n*w_n$, then we end up that the output of that neuron will be something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_2=b_2+x_1*k_1*w_1+x_2*k_2*w_2+...+x_n*k_n*w_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we update the weights of the neuron from $w_1$ to $k_1*w_1$, then we can say that the neurons from the second layer also accepts the original inputs of the previous layer. As a result, the first layer is unnecessary! In short, the neurons in a layer just spit out the linear transformation of its input to the next layer and the next layer does the same thing so on and so forth. In the end, the final result can be rewritten as the output of a single layer! **Hence, activation functions enable deep neural networks to have stacked layers and this is why they are so crucial**. In a nutshell:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we don't use non-linear activation functions in our neurons, then stacking multiple layers on top of each other becomes something unnecessary and all the layers can be collapsed to a single layer. Thus, we can only talk about deep learning as long as we use non-linear activation functions in the neurons.\n",

    "* Because of the vanishing gradient, a careful initialization of the weights of the network is important. But finding good enough values for initializing the parameters isn't trivial every time.\n",
