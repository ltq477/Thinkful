    "Before talking about the algorithm itself, let's first understand what **gradient** is. In mathematics, gradient is defined as the first derivative of function with respect to a variable. If we denote our loss function as $L(x)$ where $x$ is a parameter to be optimized, then the gradient of $L$ with respect to $x$ is denoted by $L'(x)$. Yes, it's the very first order derivative of $L$ with respect to $x$. \n",

    "The gradient descent algorithm belongs to the family of iterative algorithms. It starts with initial values (often random assignments or zero) for the parameters to be optimized.

    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the parameters with some values: \n",

    "Note that in the gradient descent algorithm, the **learning rate** parameter $\\eta$ is something that is determined outside of the model. That is to say, **the learning rate is a hyperparameter of the model to be tuned**. Setting the learning rate to a value too high or too low may have serious consequences. If we set the learning rate to a good value, two things should happen:\n",

We assume that $L_i(\\boldsymbol{W})$ is the loss function of the training data with $n$ examples. Here $\\boldsymbol{W}$ denotes the parameter vector, then we have the objective function:\n",

    "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) reduces computational cost at each iteration. At each iteration of stochastic gradient descent, we uniformly sample an index $i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ for data instances at random, and compute the gradient $\\nabla f_i(\\boldsymbol{W})$ to update $\\boldsymbol{W}$:\n",
