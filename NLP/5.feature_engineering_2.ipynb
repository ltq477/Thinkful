    "# Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the BoW approach, with all the information we were able to pull out of the text, one thing we didn't really use was semantics- the *meaning* of the words and sentences. The models we built in the previous checkpoint may know that Jane Austen tends to use the word *lady* a lot in her writing, but they don't know what a lady is. There is nothing in our work on NLP so far that would allow a model to say whether 'queen' or 'car' is more similar to 'lady.' \n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of semantic information, models can get tripped up on things like synonyms ('milady' and 'lady'). We could modify the SpaCy dictionary to include 'lady' as the lemma of 'milady,' then use lemmas for all our analyses, but for this to be an effective approach we would have to go through our entire corpus and identify all synonyms for all words by hand. This approach would also discard subtle differences in the connotations of (words, concepts, ideas, or emotions associated with) 'lady' (elicits thoughts of formal manners and England) and 'milady' (elicits thoughts of medieval ages and Rennaissance Faires).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, language is complicated, and trying to explicitly model all the information encoded in a language is nearly impossibly complicated. Fortunately, we have some approaches and methods to get around this to some extent. In general, these methods work on a corpus of text and learn the rules of the language by identifying recurring patterns within the corpus. As the outcome, all of these methods produce a numerical representation of the words.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The BoW approach rests upon counting the occurrences of the words in the documents (in our case the sentences). However, there is other information we can exploit from the occurrences of the words apart from their counts in the sentences. In the following, we'll go step by step in introducing **tf-idf** vectorization which takes some clever actions when counting the words. \n",

    "Consider the following sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The best Monty Python sketch is the one about the dead parrot,  I laughed so hard.\"\n",
    "2. \"I laugh when I think about Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch, it is funny, funny, funny, the best!\"\n",

One way to represent the sentences is in a **term-document matrix**, with a column for each sentence and a row for each word. Ignoring the stop words 'the', 'is','and', 'a', 'of,','I', and 'about,', discarding words that occur only once, and reducing words like 'laughing' to their root form ('laugh'), the term-document matrix for these sentences would be:\n",

    "The word 'best' stands out here- it appears in more sentences than any other word (4 of 6). It is used equally to describe Monty Python and ice cream. If we were to use this term-document matrix as-is to teach a computer to parse sentences, 'best' would end up as a significant identifier for both topics, and every time we gave the model a new sentence to identify that included 'best,' it would bring up both topics. Not very useful. To avoid this, we want to weight the matrix so that words that occur in many different sentences have lower weights than words that occur in fewer sentences. We do want to put a floor on this though-- words that only occur once are totally useless for finding associations between sentences.  \n",

Here, we briefly touch upon some popular NLP applications that make use of tf-idf vectorization. In the first one, we briefly review how we can measure the similarities of the documents and in the second one we talk about **topic modeling** which refers to deriving the fundamental topics of a collection of documents."

    "By now, you've had some practice thinking of data as existing in multi-dimensional space. Our sentences exist in an n-dimensional space where n is equal to the number of terms in our term-document matrix. The vector representation of the text is referred to as **Vector Space Model**. We can use this representation to compute the similarity between the sentences and a new phrase or sentence. This method is often used by search engines to match a query to possible results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the similarity of sentences to a new sentence, we transform the new sentence into a vector and place it in the space. We can then calculate how different the angles are for the original vectors and the new vector, and identify the vector whose angle is closest to the new vector. Typically this is done by calculating the cosine of the angle between the vectors. If the two vectors are identical, the angle between them will be 0° and the cosine will be 1. If the two vectors are orthogonal, with an angle of 90°, the cosine will be 0.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Cool as this is, there are limitations to the VSM.  In particular, because it treats each word as distinct from every other word, it can run aground on *synonyms* (treating words that mean the same thing as though they are different, like big and large). Also, because it treats all occurrences of a word as the same regardless of context, it can run aground on *polysemy*, where there are different meanings attached to the same word: 'I need a break' vs 'I break things.' In addition, vector space model has difficulty with very large documents because the more words a document has, the more opportunities it has to diverge from other documents in the space, making it difficult to see similarities."

    "A solution to this problem is to reduce our tf-idf-weighted term-document matrix into a lower-dimensional space, that is, to express the information in the matrix using fewer rows by combining the information from multiple terms into one new row/dimension. We do this using Principal Components Analysis. **Latent Semantic Analysis (in short LSA and also called Latent Semantic Indexing)** is the process of applying PCA to a tf-idf matrix. What we get, in the end, is clusters of terms that presumably reflect a topic. Each document will get a score for each topic, with higher scores indicating that the document is relevant to the topic. Documents can pertain to more than one topic.\n",
